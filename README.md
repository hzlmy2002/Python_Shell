### Project Management

- Agile/scrum methodology
- Rough timeline of milestones
- Focus on delivering sprint goals, reflecting, and refactoring plan, design & implementation
- Self-organisation
- Meetings for code and design reviews - reflect and change/refactor anything necessary
- Order sprints in a way that set us up well for each subsequent sprint
- Stick to design principles & patterns
- Unit and integration testing (continuous integration?)
- Github flow

### Agreed code style

TBC

### Backlog
- ~~Refactor design into basic architechture
- Preserve the following functionalities, improving design and implementation:
  - Shell features:
    - Calling applications
    - Quoting
    - Semicolon operator (Executing several commands in one line)
    - Globbing (Like regex, used for matching filenames)
  - Applications:
    - cd
    - pwd
    - ls
    - cat
    - echo
    - head
    - tail
    - grep
- Testing (unit and integration)
- Implement the following functionalities:
  - Shell features:
    - pipe
    - IO-redirection
    - command substitution
    
  - Applications: 
  
    - find
  
    - sort
  
    - uniq
  
    - cut
- And unsafe version of all above
- Add extra/more advanced functionality/testing/code analysis etc.
